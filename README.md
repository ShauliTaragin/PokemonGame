<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

#### Task 5 Object-Oriented Programming

***Authors : Shauli Taragin & Ido Bar***  

In this project we implemented algorithms for developing a pokemon game on a directed weighted graph.


We also created an enhanced Graphical User Interface to visualize any given game stage.


---------

## Plan and design of The Project

Upon planning are project we would like to focus on 3 fields for which we wish to plan elaborately before we begin implementing code.
<li> Planning the main classes:</li>
We will implement a class for each interface. Our GraphAlgo and DiGraph classes will hold all the functions it implements from the interface as well as other functions which we will elaborate on in the next paragraph.
We will also implement a Node class which implements A basic node class. In the GraphAlgo class we will also create our main algorithms.
<li> Planning the method of implementation:</li>
We will create a dictionary that every key is the Node Id and the value is the Node Object.
Every NodeData will contain two dict's :1. A dict of the out edges that the current node is their source, the key of the HpokaballMap will be the Id of the destination node and the value will be the Edge's weight.
2. A dict of the in Edges that the current node is their destination the key is the src and the weight of the edge.
The key will be the Id of the source node and the value will be the weight of the edge.
<li> Planning the dijkstra algorithm:</li>
We wanted to implement the dijkstra algorithm in the most elegant ,most efficient way possible. Obviously the dijkstra algorithm is needed for calculating the center, shortest path, and tsp methods.
So we will achieve this by creating an instance of a MinHeapDijkstra. e.g Instead of implemnting dijkstra with a priority queue we will apply the min heap data structure which we will create on the dijkstra algorithm.
<li> Laying out testing methods :</li>
Beyond testing all the implemented methods from the interface We would like to check the next methods:1. Create graph by adding nodes and edges.
2. Connect two nodes. 3. Delete node. 4. Delete edge from the graph. 5. Get the correct mode count.
6. Get the correct size of edges and the correct size of nodes.

## GUI
#### We will explain about our gui as well as give a short and easy manual of how the user can use it easily.

* About our GUI :
In our display of the graph the user must create a graph(either load or create) for the GraphAlgo method, and call the plot_graph function.

The graph is represented in the following manner : 

Nodes are represented by black circles. Each node's key is written above it in blue.

Edges are represented by red lines with an arrow at the end showing the direction of the edge.

Inorder to run a gui performance for a graph of you're choice, the user must work from the main class.

The user can either create a graph by adding nodes and edges e.g. check0 or load a graph of their choice which is located in the data package.

Either way the gui implementation is called from the interface function plot_graph

#### Note : This graph will change everytime we call it. Since there was no geolocatoin inserted for the nodes we randomly inserted proper locations for each node. More information on how we did that can be found in our DiGraph class 

---------

## The Algorithm
***The GraphAlgoInterface interface is implemented in GraphAlgo class:***
***The GraphAlgo object contains a class member of A graph of type DiGraph inorder to activate the algorithms on.***

We will lay out our graph Theory algorithms and explain how we implemented them:

1. **init**- Initializes the graph from a json file .
2. **load_from_json**- Load from a json file a graph to work our algorithms on .
3. **save_to_json**- Saves the graph to a json file.
6. **shortestPath**- Calculates the shortest path distance between 2 given nodes.
   1. We implement this algorithm as well as the shortestpath and tsp algorithm in the following manner.
   2. In order to find the shortest path between two nodes we run the dijkstra algorithm using a data structure of Min Heap.Both these methods are implemnted in the DijkstraUsingMinHeap class
   3. Then fitting the algorithm to our data structures that we are using to represent the graph.
   4.    We hold with lists the path we took to reach the shortest distance
   2. We iterate over our lists and hold in a list the path the algorithm traveled.
   5. Finally, returning a tuple of a pair of the weight of the shortest path and the list of the path we took.
8. **Center** - Finds the shortest path (at what edges should we use the path) between 2 given nodes in the graph.   
9. **TSP**- Computes a relatively short path which visit each node in the cities List.
   1. We run the same methods as 5. With additions that we run each of the cities as a src and find in a greedy way the shortest path to travel through all the cities
   2. In this solution we also hold with arrays the path we took to reach the shortest distance.
   3. We iterate over our arrays and return in a list the path the algorithm traveled.
